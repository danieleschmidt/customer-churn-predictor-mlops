# Supply Chain Security

This document describes the comprehensive supply chain security measures implemented in this project to protect against software supply chain attacks and ensure the integrity of our dependencies and build process.

## Overview

Supply chain security is critical for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of our ML system. This document outlines our multi-layered approach to securing the software supply chain.

## Security Measures

### 1. Dependency Management

#### Dependency Pinning
- All production dependencies are pinned to specific versions in `requirements.lock`
- Development dependencies are pinned in `requirements-dev.lock`
- Regular updates through automated dependency management

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Safety**: Scans Python packages for known security vulnerabilities
- **Pip-audit**: Advanced vulnerability detection for Python packages
- **Dependabot**: Automated vulnerability alerts and security updates
- **GitHub Advisory Database**: Integration with security advisories

#### Dependency Review
- Mandatory dependency review process for all new dependencies
- Security assessment of transitive dependencies
- License compatibility verification
- Maintenance status evaluation

### 2. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

#### SBOM Generation
```bash
# Generate SBOM for the project
pip-licenses --format=json --output=sbom.json
syft packages dir:. -o spdx-json=sbom-spdx.json
```

#### SBOM Components
- Direct dependencies with versions
- Transitive dependencies
- License information
- Vulnerability data
- Component signatures

#### SBOM Management
- Generated automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Stored with each release
- Version-controlled for historical tracking
- Available for security audits

### 3. Code Signing and Verification

#### Commit Signing
- GPG signing required for all commits to main branch
- Verification of commit signatures in CI/CD
- Developer key management and rotation

#### Container Image Signing
```bash
# Sign container images with cosign
cosign sign --key cosign.key $IMAGE_URI
```

#### Artifact Signing
- Release artifacts signed with project keys
- Checksums provided for all downloadable artifacts
- Signature verification instructions in documentation

### 4. Build Security

#### Reproducible Builds
- Deterministic build process
- Pinned build tool versions
- Consistent build environment (Docker)
- Build provenance tracking

#### Build Environment Security
- Isolated build environments
- Minimal base images
- Regular security updates
- Access controls and auditing

#### Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Compliance

##### SLSA Level 1: Documentation
- Build process documentation
- Provenance generation
- Source identification

##### SLSA Level 2: Hosted Build Service
- Version-controlled source
- Generated provenance
- Build service integration

##### SLSA Level 3: Hardened Builds
- Source/build integrity verification
- Isolated build environment
- Non-falsifiable provenance

##### SLSA Level 4: Highest Level
- Two-person review of changes
- Hermetic builds
- Reproducible builds

### 5. Infrastructure Security

#### Registry Security
- Private container registry usage
- Image scanning before deployment
- Access controls and authentication
- Regular registry security updates

#### CI/CD Pipeline Security
- Secrets management with rotation
- Least privilege access controls
- Pipeline integrity verification
- Audit logging and monitoring

#### Runtime Security
- Container runtime security monitoring
- Network segmentation
- Resource limits and quotas
- Intrusion detection systems

### 6. Monitoring and Detection

#### Supply Chain Monitoring
- Real-time vulnerability alerts
- Dependency drift detection
- Unusual package behavior monitoring
- Supply chain attack indicators

#### Security Metrics
- Time to patch vulnerabilities
- Dependency freshness metrics
- Security scan coverage
- Incident response times

#### Alerting and Response
- Automated security notifications
- Escalation procedures
- Incident response playbooks
- Post-incident reviews

## Implementation

### Automated Security Checks

#### Pre-commit Hooks
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: safety-check
        name: Safety vulnerability scan
        entry: safety check --json --output safety-report.json
        language: system
        files: requirements.*\.txt$
        
      - id: bandit-check
        name: Bandit security linting
        entry: bandit -r src/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
        language: system
        files: \.py$
```

#### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
name: Supply Chain Security

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        scan-type: 'fs'
        scan-ref: '.'
        format: 'sarif'
        output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
        
    - name: Upload Trivy scan results
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
      with:
        sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```
