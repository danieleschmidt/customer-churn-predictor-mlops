# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Customer Churn Predictor is a production-ready MLOps system designed to predict customer churn using machine learning. The architecture follows cloud-native patterns with containerization, monitoring, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Component Architecture

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Input**: Raw customer data in CSV format
- **Validation**: Schema validation, data quality checks
- **Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, encoding, scaling
- **Output**: Processed features ready for model training

### Model Training System
- **Framework**: Scikit-learn with logistic regression
- **Tracking**: MLflow for experiment management
- **Versioning**: Model artifacts stored with metadata
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and performance metrics

### API Service
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance REST API
- **Authentication**: Bearer token-based security
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request throttling
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics endpoints

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Raw customer data loaded from CSV files
2. **Validation**: Data quality checks and schema validation
3. **Preprocessing**: Feature engineering and transformation
4. **Training**: Model training with hyperparameter optimization
5. **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and model validation
6. **Deployment**: Model serving via REST API
7. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and drift detection

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key-based authentication
- Constant-time comparison for security
- Environment-based key management
