# Customer Churn Predictor MLOps - Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Name
Customer Churn Predictor with MLOps Implementation

### Project Sponsor
Terragon Labs Development Team

### Project Manager
Autonomous Development Agent (Terry)

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical business challenge that directly impacts revenue and growth. Organizations need accurate, scalable, and production-ready machine learning solutions to predict and prevent customer churn. This project addresses the gap between experimental ML models and production-ready MLOps systems.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Data Pipeline**: Robust data preprocessing and validation systems
- **Model Development**: Binary classification model for churn prediction
- **MLOps Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD pipeline for ML workflows
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Production monitoring and alerting systems
- **API Services**: REST API for real-time predictions
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical and user documentation

### Out of Scope
- Real-time streaming data processing
- Multi-model ensemble predictions
- Custom UI/dashboard development (beyond API)
- Integration with specific CRM systems

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- **Model Performance**: Achieve >85% accuracy on test dataset
- **API Performance**: <100ms response time for prediction requests
- **System Reliability**: 99.5% uptime for production services
- **Code Quality**: >80% test coverage, zero critical security vulnerabilities
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline with <5 minute deploy time

### Business Success Metrics
- **Reproducibility**: 100% reproducible experiments and deployments
- **Maintainability**: <2 hours average time to onboard new developers
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent prediction requests
- **Compliance**: Full SLSA Level 2 compliance for supply chain security

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementation and maintenance
- **Data Science Team**: Model development and validation
- **DevOps Team**: Infrastructure and deployment operations
- **Business Users**: End users of prediction capabilities

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **QA Team**: Testing and quality assurance
- **Documentation Team**: Technical writing and user guides

## Timeline and Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- Core MLflow integration
- Basic model training pipeline
- Docker containerization
- Initial testing framework

### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Current)
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Security implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- Advanced model management
- A/B testing framework
- Cost optimization
- Advanced analytics

## Budget and Resources

### Resource Allocation
- **Development Time**: 160 hours (4 person-weeks)
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud computing resources for CI/CD
- **Tooling**: MLflow, Prometheus, GitHub Actions (all open-source)
- **Security**: Security scanning and compliance tools

### Cost Considerations
- Minimal infrastructure costs due to open-source tooling
- Primary investment in development and setup time
- Long-term savings through automation and reproducibility

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Model Performance**: Risk of not meeting accuracy targets
   - Mitigation: Extensive data validation and model tuning
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Risk of data breaches or unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive security testing and authentication
3. **Scalability Limitations**: Risk of performance degradation under load
   - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Technical Debt**: Risk of poor code quality affecting maintainability
   - Mitigation: Automated code quality checks and reviews
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Risk of poor adoption due to inadequate documentation
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation strategy

## Governance and Decision Making

### Decision Authority
- **Technical Decisions**: Development Team Lead
- **Architecture Decisions**: Documented via Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Security Decisions**: Security Team review required
- **Business Decisions**: Project Sponsor approval required

### Communication Plan
- **Status Updates**: Weekly progress reports
- **Issue Escalation**: Direct to Project Sponsor for blocking issues
- **Documentation**: All decisions documented in project repository

## Success Definition
