    'storage_cost_per_gb_month': 0.0,
    'network_cost_per_gb': 0.0,
    'total_monthly_cost': 0.0
}

def track_cost_metrics():
    """Track and report cost metrics"""
    # Implementation for cost tracking
    pass
```

#### Cost Alerting
```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules for cost monitoring
groups:
- name: cost.rules
  rules:
  - alert: HighComputeCost
    expr: compute_cost_per_hour > 10
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "High compute cost detected"
      description: "Compute cost is {{ $value }} per hour"
      
  - alert: StorageCostSpike
    expr: increase(storage_cost_total[24h]) > 100
    for: 1h
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Storage cost spike detected"

# Shutdown non-critical services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

#### Right-sizing Automation
```python
# Automated right-sizing recommendations
def analyze_resource_utilization():
    """Analyze resource utilization and provide recommendations"""
    recommendations = []
    
    # CPU utilization analysis
    if avg_cpu_utilization < 30:
        recommendations.append("Consider downsizing CPU allocation")
    
    # Memory utilization analysis
    if avg_memory_utilization < 40:
        recommendations.append("Consider reducing memory allocation")
        
    return recommendations
```
