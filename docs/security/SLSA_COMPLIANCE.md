# SLSA Compliance Documentation

## Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)

This document outlines our SLSA compliance strategy and current implementation status for the Customer Churn Predictor MLOps project.

## SLSA Framework Overview

SLSA is a security framework that provides guidelines for securing software supply chains. It defines four levels of security requirements:

- **SLSA Level 1**: Basic provenance and build process requirements
- **SLSA Level 2**: Enhanced provenance with authenticated builds
- **SLSA Level 3**: Hardened build platforms with non-falsifiable provenance
- **SLSA Level 4**: Highest level with hermetic builds and two-party review

## Current SLSA Compliance Status

### SLSA Level 1 âœ… ACHIEVED

**Requirements Met:**
- âœ… Build process is scripted and automated
- âœ… Provenance is available for all build artifacts
- âœ… Build service generates provenance automatically

**Implementation:**
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- Docker image builds with metadata and labels
- MLflow experiment tracking with artifact provenance
- Dependency lock files committed to version control

### SLSA Level 2 ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

**Requirements:**
- âœ… Version control system tracks all source code changes
- âœ… Build service is hosted and managed
- âœ… Provenance is authenticated and non-forgeable
- ðŸ”„ Two-person review for all changes (via CODEOWNERS)

**Current Implementation:**
- GitHub-hosted runners provide authenticated build environment
- Signed commits and protected main branch
- CODEOWNERS file enforces code review requirements
- Dependabot automated dependency management

**Next Steps for Level 2:**
- Implement mandatory two-person review for all critical changes
- Add signing verification for all artifacts
- Enhance build provenance with cryptographic signatures

### SLSA Level 3 ðŸŽ¯ TARGET

**Requirements:**
- Hardened build platform
- Non-falsifiable provenance
- Isolated build environment
- Explicit review of source code changes

**Planned Implementation:**
- GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted hardened runners
- Sigstore/Cosign integration for artifact signing
- Container image signing and verification
- Build reproducibility verification

### SLSA Level 4 ðŸ”® FUTURE

**Requirements:**
- Hermetic builds (no external dependencies during build)
- Two-party review for all changes
- Immutable reference to dependencies

**Future Considerations:**
- Fully hermetic build environment
- Enhanced dependency management with cryptographic verification
- Advanced threat modeling and risk assessment

## Implementation Checklist

### Build System Security

- [x] Dependencies are pinned and locked
- [ ] Build artifacts are signed
- [ ] Build reproducibility is verified

### Source Code Security
- [x] Version control with full history
- [x] Protected main branch
- [x] Required status checks
- [x] Code review requirements
- [x] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Mandatory two-person review for critical paths

### Artifact Security
- [x] Container images with security scanning
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] SBOM generation capability
- [ ] Artifact signing implementation
- [ ] Provenance verification

### Monitoring and Compliance
- [x] Security scanning in CI/CD
- [x] Dependency update automation
- [x] Audit logging
- [ ] Compliance reporting dashboard
- [ ] Regular security assessments

## Tools and Technologies

### Current Security Stack
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Static analysis and security checks
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Hadolint**: Docker security best practices
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Code scanning and secret detection

### Planned Additions
- **Sigstore/Cosign**: Artifact signing and verification
- **SLSA Verifier**: Provenance verification
- **Trivy/Grype**: Enhanced container and filesystem scanning
- **SPDX/CycloneDx**: Advanced SBOM generation

## Compliance Verification

### Automated Checks
```bash
# Verify build reproducibility
make verify-reproducible-build

# Check artifact signatures
cosign verify --key cosign.pub <artifact>

# Validate SLSA provenance
slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> --provenance <provenance.json>

# Generate compliance report
python scripts/generate-compliance-report.py
```

### Manual Audits
- Quarterly SLSA compliance assessment
- Annual third-party security review
- Regular penetration testing
- Supply chain risk assessment
