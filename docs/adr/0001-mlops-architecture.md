# ADR-0001: MLOps Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a robust MLOps architecture for the customer churn prediction system that supports:
- Reproducible model training and deployment
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Automated testing and validation
- Production monitoring and alerting

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive MLOps architecture with the following components:

### Core Technologies
- **MLflow**: For experiment tracking, model registry, and artifact management
- **FastAPI**: For serving models via REST API
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment consistency
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD automation
- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection and monitoring

### Architecture Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data processing, model training, and serving
2. **Reproducibility**: All experiments and deployments must be reproducible
3. **Automation**: Minimize manual intervention in the ML pipeline
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability at all levels
5. **Security**: Security-first approach with authentication and validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Standardized ML workflow across the organization
- Improved model reproducibility and traceability
- Faster deployment cycles with automated testing
- Better model performance monitoring in production
- Reduced technical debt through consistent practices

### Negative
- Initial complexity in setup and configuration
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with MLOps tools
- Additional infrastructure costs for monitoring and tracking
- Potential over-engineering for simple use cases

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Tool Lock-in**: Mitigated by using open-source tools and standard interfaces
- **Complexity**: Addressed through comprehensive documentation and training
- **Performance**: Regular performance testing and optimization

## Implementation Timeline
- Phase 1: Core MLflow integration (Complete)
- Phase 2: Enhanced monitoring and alerting (In Progress)
- Phase 3: Advanced model management features (Q3 2025)
