# Incident Response Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides step-by-step procedures for responding to production incidents.

## Incident Severity Levels

### P0 - Critical
- Complete system outage
- Data loss or corruption
- Security breach

### P1 - High
- Major feature unavailable
- Performance severely degraded
- Partial service outage

### P2 - Medium
- Minor feature issues
- Moderate performance impact
- Non-critical functionality affected

### P3 - Low
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation errors
- Minor bugs with workarounds

## Response Procedures

### Initial Response (First 5 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge the incident**
   - Log into monitoring dashboard
   - Check system health metrics
   - Verify the scope of impact

2. **Assess severity**
   - Determine incident level (P0-P3)
   - Identify affected services
   - Estimate user impact

3. **Communicate**
   - Notify incident response team
   - Update status page if customer-facing
   - Create incident channel

### Investigation (5-30 minutes)
1. **Gather data**
   - Check logs in monitoring systems
   - Review recent deployments
   - Examine error rates and metrics

2. **Form hypothesis**
   - Identify potential root causes
   - Prioritize investigation areas
   - Assign team members to specific areas

### Resolution
1. **Implement fix**
   - Apply immediate mitigation if available
   - Test fix in staging environment
   - Deploy fix to production

2. **Verify resolution**
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Confirm user reports cease
   - Validate system stability

### Post-Incident
1. **Communication**
   - Update all stakeholders
   - Close incident channel
   - Schedule post-mortem meeting

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete incident report
   - Update runbooks based on learnings
   - Track action items
