## 2. Decision-Making Process

### RFC (Request for Comments) Process

#### When to Use RFC
- Major architectural changes
- New technology adoption
- Breaking API changes
- Security policy modifications
- Performance optimization strategies

#### RFC Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Author creates initial RFC document
2. **Review**: Technical team reviews and provides feedback
3. **Discussion**: Open discussion period (minimum 1 week)
4. **Decision**: Steering committee makes final decision
5. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs move to implementation
6. **Monitoring**: Post-implementation review and monitoring

### Consensus Building
- **Lazy Consensus**: Proposals proceed unless objections are raised within 72 hours
- **Active Consensus**: Explicit approval required for critical decisions
- **Escalation Path**: Unresolved conflicts escalate to Steering Committee

## 3. Code Review and Quality Standards

### Review Requirements
- **All code changes** require at least 2 reviewers
- **Security-sensitive changes** require security team review
- **Infrastructure changes** require DevOps team review
- **ML model changes** require ML engineering review
- **Breaking changes** require architecture board approval

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass (unit, integration, security)
- Code coverage must be â‰¥ 80%
- Security scans must show no high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must meet defined thresholds
- Documentation must be updated for public APIs

### Merge Criteria
- Branch protection rules enforced
- Status checks must pass
- Required reviewers must approve
- No merge commits (squash and merge preferred)
- Signed commits required for production branches

## 4. Release Management

### Release Types
- **Major Release** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, new features
- **Minor Release** (x.Y.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch Release** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, security patches
- **Hotfix Release**: Critical security or bug fixes

### Release Process
1. **Planning**: Release planning meeting with stakeholders
2. **Development**: Feature development and testing
3. **Stabilization**: Bug fixing and performance optimization
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing including security and performance
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation and release notes
6. **Deployment**: Staged deployment with monitoring
7. **Monitoring**: Post-release monitoring and issue tracking

### Release Approval
- **Major/Minor Releases**: Steering Committee approval required
- **Patch Releases**: Technical Lead approval sufficient
- **Hotfix Releases**: Can be expedited with security team approval

## 5. Security Governance

### Security Policies
- All dependencies must be scanned for vulnerabilities
- Security reviews required for new features
- Incident response plan must be followed for security issues
- Regular security audits conducted quarterly
- Penetration testing performed annually

### Vulnerability Management
- **Critical**: Fix within 24 hours
- **High**: Fix within 7 days
- **Medium**: Fix within 30 days
- **Low**: Fix in next minor release

### Access Controls
- **Production Access**: Limited to DevOps and Security teams
- **Sensitive Data**: Data engineers and approved ML engineers only
- **Administrative Access**: Requires dual approval
- **Service Accounts**: Regularly rotated and audited

## 6. Compliance and Audit

### Compliance Frameworks
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual compliance audit
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance
- **SLSA Level 3**: Supply chain security compliance

### Audit Requirements
- **Code Audits**: Quarterly internal security code reviews
- **Infrastructure Audits**: Semi-annual infrastructure security reviews
- **Process Audits**: Annual governance and process effectiveness reviews
- **Third-party Audits**: Annual external security assessments

### Documentation Requirements
- All processes must be documented
- Decision rationale must be recorded
- Audit trails must be maintained
- Compliance evidence must be preserved

## 7. Communication and Transparency

### Communication Channels
- **All Hands**: Monthly project updates
- **Technical Updates**: Bi-weekly engineering updates
- **Security Bulletins**: As needed for security issues
- **Release Notes**: Detailed notes for each release

### Documentation Standards
- **Architecture Decisions**: Documented in ADRs
- **API Changes**: Documented in API specifications
- **Security Procedures**: Documented in security runbooks
- **Operational Procedures**: Documented in operational runbooks

### Transparency Principles
- Open source dependencies and licenses tracked
- Security vulnerability disclosure policy published
- Performance metrics and SLAs published
- Incident post-mortems shared (with sensitive data redacted)

## 8. Performance and Quality Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Development Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Code Quality**: Code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, technical debt
- **Security Posture**: Vulnerability count by severity, time to remediation
- **Operational Excellence**: Uptime, MTTR, deployment frequency
- **Customer Satisfaction**: API response times, error rates, feature adoption

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% line coverage
- **Performance**: 99th percentile response time < 1 second
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities in production
- **Maintainability**: Technical debt ratio < 5%

## 9. Risk Management

### Risk Categories
- **Technical Risks**: Technology obsolescence, performance degradation
- **Security Risks**: Data breaches, vulnerability exploitation
- **Operational Risks**: Service outages, data loss
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory violations, audit failures
- **Business Risks**: Market changes, competitive threats

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Regular risk assessments and reviews
- Disaster recovery and business continuity planning
- Security incident response procedures
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Compliance monitoring and reporting

## 10. Change Management

### Change Categories
- **Emergency Changes**: Critical security or production issues
- **Standard Changes**: Pre-approved, low-risk changes
- **Normal Changes**: Regular development and feature changes
- **Major Changes**: Significant architectural or process changes

### Change Approval Process
- **Emergency**: Security team approval, post-implementation review
- **Standard**: Automated approval with monitoring
- **Normal**: Peer review and testing required
- **Major**: Architecture board and steering committee approval

### Change Documentation
- All changes must be documented in change log
- Risk assessment required for major changes
- Rollback procedures must be defined
- Success criteria must be established
